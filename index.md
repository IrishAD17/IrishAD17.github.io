### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite of mine because it was my first time doing code myself. I was really excited to start coding and I had learned a lot from just the first lab we did. After this first lab I was also excited to work on the upcoming ones.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 had 2 parts as well. The first being about finding the averages between tests. Here we used arguments again but we put them into arguments. The vector was looped which added up the test scores.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, The first part of lab 6 I found interesting. I found this lab fun and interesting because we had to take arguments on what were ingrediants of a sandwhich and what the arguments had meant. In part 2 I found this fun because it was about blackjack and we used arguments again.
