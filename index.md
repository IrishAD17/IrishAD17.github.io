### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was a favorite of mine because it was my first time doing code myself. I was really excited to start coding and I had learned a lot from it. After this lab I was also excited to work on the upcoming ones.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 had to do with making a game. Which the game was blackjack and coding it was fun. I really enjoyed the labs where it involved coding a game because it gives you something to play after the lab is finished.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, I liked that in part two it had to do with making a game which I found to be fun. Although part 1 was a bit of a challenge, I still found it fun as well. Again I really enjoy labs involved with coding games because I can show it to friends or family and they acn try it out.
